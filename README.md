This repository contains the official implementation of the following paper:
> **Development Tool based on 5W1H Programming Model for Novice Programmer**<br>
>
> *In this paper, we present a 5W1H programming model for IT non-experienced people who are not familiar with computer programming and those who need programming education. Based on this model, we can design a development tool that can be easily programmed by beginners . This development tool is a programming method applying the 5W1H concept and constructs a sentence to satisfy the control condition of 'Who, When, Where, What, and How', which is the sentence element of 5W1H. Therefore, the user can easily develop the target system as if constructing the sentence without learning the programming language of the target system. In this paper, to verify the effectiveness of the 5W1H programming model proposed in this paper, we applied the concept of 5W1H programming to Arduino and developed the development tool and performed the first verification and applied the second verification to the speech recognition smart home development platform.*
